    <p>It's no huge mistake: The Bluths are back! Improbably, more than six years after <em>Fox</em>em> canceled the cult-comedy favorite, <em>Arrested Development</em> returns with 15 new episodes exclusively on <em>Netflix</em>, available for streaming all at once, <strong>Sunday at 3:01 a.m ET/12:01 a.m. PT</strong>.And diehard fans can't wait, if activity on <em>Netflix</em> and social media is any indication. "It's seemingly reached a fever pitch in the last couple of weeks," says <em>Will Arnett</em>, who plays the family's misguided magician son George Oscar Bluth, more familiarly known as "Gob." "Certainly the show's never been more popular than it is now," he says, as many younger fans discovered it online only after the show went off the air.</p>
